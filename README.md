# How to install multiple apps in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-nodejs-webdriver-multipleApps) using the Appium & NodeJS Webdriver.io Framework

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where the APP1 that you are testing needs to interact with a few other applications APP2, APP3. In this scenario, LambdaTest offers an easy way out where you can just [upload your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) & add them to the multiple apps array.
It becomes extremely convenient now where you can just add those URLs & run your tests with ease. 

# Steps:

You can add the app URLs fetched by [uploading your apps](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/appium-java/#upload-your-application) in the ```otherApps``` capability.

Below is the ```android-single.conf.js``` example shown:

```js
exports.config = {
  user: process.env.LT_USERNAME || "YOUR_USERNAME",
  key: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY || "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",

  updateJob: false,
  specs: ["./../specs/android-test.js"],
  exclude: [],

  capabilities: [
    {
      build: "NodeJS WebDriverIO Android",
      name: "Sample Test - WebDriverIO",
      isRealMobile: true,
      platformName: "Android",
      deviceName: "Galaxy S9",
      platformVersion: "10",
      app: "YOUR_APP_URL", //Set your APP URL

      // ADD THE APP URL OF OTHER APPS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO INSTALL ON THE SAME DEVICE
      otherApps: "['lt:// ', 'lt:// ']",   //ENTER THE OTHER APP URLs HERE IN AN ARRAY FORMAT

    },
  ],

  logLevel: "info",
  coloredLogs: true,
  screenshotPath: "./errorShots/",
  baseUrl: "",
  waitforTimeout: 10000,
  connectionRetryTimeout: 90000,
  connectionRetryCount: 3,
  path: "/wd/hub",
  hostname: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com",
  port: 80,

  framework: "mocha",
  mochaOpts: {
    ui: "bdd",
    timeout: 20000,
  },
};
```

## Executing The Tests

```bash
npm run single
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

If you are using an **android** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding Android app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
node ios.js
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
